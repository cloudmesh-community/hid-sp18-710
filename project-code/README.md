http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/

For this analysis we will use the data set from the gun violence archive which contains data from the year 2013 to 2018 


## Requirements

* Python 3.7
* Packages: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn, Cufflinks, Sklearn
* Tools: Anaconda, Jupyter notebook or Microsoft Azure account
* Python 3.7 

### Setup

* Create the free account on Microsoft Azure. You will get free credit of 200$ for 12 months.
    *	Create resource on azure portal from left hand side pane.
    *	Create new storage instance under resource group field.
    *	Create a new container which can store the files in it. Store the dataset into the container.
    *	Once the dataset is pushed into the cloud, we can have access to it using the login credentials.
*	The entire code can be run in jupyter notebook with given sequence of the cell. Before running code please make sure all the below packages are pre-installed in local machine.


### Installation

The following python packages need to be installed before we can run the code in the Jupyter Notebooks. 

 ```python
     pip install jupyter
