        The data volume is increasing at high velocity and it comes
        from various sources with different formats.These data no
        longer fits into defined structure and hence the need for
        handling the big data using NoSQL.This paper will highlight on
        what is NoSQL and where and when it should be used for and
        also why Big Data can not be handled in traditional RDBMS.

        In recent history, the explosion of smart devices, social
        media platforms and the Internet of Things has resulted in
        major replication of data.  This data is transferred at high
        speeds, in large volumes and in a variety of different
        platforms. Data is one of the biggest assets of companies and
        with the exponential growth of data comes an increasing
        problem: Security and Privacy. Security and privacy have
        become a major initiative for every organization that has or
        utilizes databases.  These organizations need to protect their
        brands, avoid penalties, and, in worst case scenarios, avoid
        circumstances in which they may either lose a significant
        amount of business or their business as a whole. The computer
        science industry, alongside of these organizations, need to
        continue to develop ways to protect, utilize, and gain
        real-time insight from the data that each organization
        has. This paper is going to highlight security and privacy in
        Big Data, alongside of specific issues and challenges related
        to security.

    title:  Cmd5 plugin to Creates a Docker Swarm Cluster on 3 Raspberry Pis
    abstract: >
        Information technologies are evolving from mainly one-host environments to 
        more distributed environment. Docker Swarm makes it possible to avoid having a 
        single point of failure and instead, have multiple nodes that can be properly 
        balanced and contain replicas of the information. Currently, Dockers must be 
        individually downloaded, installed and configured on each physical computer in 
        order for the desired computers to work in swarm mode. This paper details the 
        development of a plug-in that would allow CloudMesh to deploy a Docker Swarm cluster.  
        The creation of this plug-in would be the first step towards the development of
        a tool which would allow larger debian based networks to work as container oriented 
        virtual environments with optimized usage of resources.
